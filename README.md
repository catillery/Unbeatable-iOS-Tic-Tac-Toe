# iOS Tic-Tac-Toe
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game for iOS mobile devices with an unbeatable AI. Functionality for both player versus player and player versus AI games.

## Getting Started and Executing the Program

Download the application to any iOS device or compile and use a simulator within XCode to make use of the application.

## Application Functionality
Simply launch the application on your device, and select a game mode (Player vs. Player or Player vs. AI). Default settings will apply immediately (on first launch) for volume, difficulty, board pieces, and the unbeatable toggle. Settings will persist between play sessions. A game should launch immediately after choosing a game mode and the rules of standard Tic-Tac-Toe apply. AI always goes first, but players take turns as the first move in player vs. player. The reset button resets all scores and clears the board. Navigation between views should be intuitive and straightforward.

You have the ability to make changes to all of the previously listed settings. This can be done by clicking on the cog on the bottom left of any view. Changes apply whenever a new round begins (whether by resetting the board or by a win/loss/tie). The difficulties simply alter the percentage that the AI makes the ideal move. The unbeatable AI toggle makes the AI always choose the ideal move. You can only tie (at best) with this toggle on.
